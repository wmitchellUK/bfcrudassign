# Welcome to ByteFoods Python/Flask CRUD App!

- Its primarily leverages SQLAlchemy, Flask.
- DataImport can be run via the app which should populate the DataSet into a SQLite / MySQL database.
- Functionality for Create, Read, Update and Delete 
- It also has support for docker and I have this hosted as an image on dockerhub.
- I've also had this running on my google cloud platform using kubernetes.


A few todos that I'd like to get done given a little more time.
- Pagination !
- Reusing the template for view,create and update
- Better structuring 
- Tests
- Auth 
- More validation
- Add a REST API
- Make my morning coffee :)
